The Shader graph has the outline metarial attached

The outline meterial is then attached to the "URP â€“ HighFidelity-Rederer" found in settings

which works though a pass metarial in the "Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature"

If you want to change the outline color go to materials and click on the outline

then "Outline Color" you can change the colour there

as well as the "Color Threshold" and the "Normal Theshold"

You can press play and move around 

To go foward is: W
To go backwards is: S
To go Right is: D
To go left is: A 

And you can use the mouse to look around

You will see the shader working when looking around and i left objects in the middle 
you can see the shader work better on. 

These Instuctions Can Also Be Seen In Unity

Enjoy!
