For the FPS Counter to work you will need textMeshPro (TMP)

The Fps counter runs of a script which is attached to the canvas 
The Canvas used the "Text (TMP)" to display the text
This is all attached to the camera 

To see the fps work you can just press play 
it will show up on the top left of your screen 

Controls: 

To go foward is: W
To go backwards is: S
To go Right is: D
To go left is: A 

And you can use the mouse to look around

You will see the shader working when looking around and i left objects in the middle 
you can see the shader work better on. 

These Instuctions Can Also Be Seen In Unity

Enjoy!
