For the Speedometer You can click on Canvas, Speedometer and then needle
Here in the inspector you can see how fast the bike is going in mph 
as well as seeing how fast it goes on the speedometer in the Game.

There is a script linked to the needle of the speedometer
this script calculates the bikes speed in Meters per Secound 
Then turns it into mph and then turns the needle based on that 
as well as displays the speed in the inspector
the bikes max speed is 160 mph

the script on the bike (car) is a simple script which allows us to use our controls. 
 
Controls: 

To go Right (Foward) is: D
To go left (Backwards) is: A 

the longer you press the controls the faster you will go till you either
hit the wall or let go of the key

there are cubes around the bike
so the bike will never flyout the camera view.

These Instuctions Can Also Be Seen In Unity

Enjoy!
