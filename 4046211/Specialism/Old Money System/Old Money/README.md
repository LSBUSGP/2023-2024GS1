# Old Money System

This project is a monetary system devloped for use in a game based in Britain before the decimalisation of their currency.
## Features

You are able to:
- **Pick up money** - Click on any of the coins or note in the holder.
- **Spend money** - Click on any of the other objects.
- **See your balance** - Look at the bottom corner next to the money bag.

You are not able to go into negative balance.

There are tooltips when you hover over **money** or **items** which tell the player what they are picking up or how much an item is.
