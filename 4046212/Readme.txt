Game Specialism Programming.

Here are the three completed programming briefs.

The briefs chosen are: Radar, Instanced Scrolling Material and Speedometer.

The assets and scripts are included in each package, they just need to be imported in to unity.

The unity files are also included and are named respectively to each brief.

The speedometer unity files were too large so the library file had to be deleted, the package is there however and works.
